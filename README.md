BlueTorino is a car sharing company. I had to take a flight for Christmas holidays. I usually go reach the airport with a BlueTorino car, but that day there wasn't any parking at the airport.

I decided to write a JS script that would try to book the parking every N seconds, alerting me on success.

The script works, but that day it didn't book the spot so I took the bus.

In 2019 BlueTorino has developed a function that allows you to enqueue yourself for a parking spot, so my script is now useless.
